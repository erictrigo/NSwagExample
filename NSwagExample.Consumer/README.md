This project simulates what would happen if we had a project referencing a NSwag generated client and then we updated the NSwag version.

How to use:

- Build one of the above projects
- Uncomment the `Consumer` class for the version that just had a NSwag generated client
- See comments in the corresponding `Consumer` class
- Repeat steps for another project
